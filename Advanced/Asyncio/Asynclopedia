1. "Technically, await is more closely analogous to yield from than it is to yield. 
    (But remember that yield from x() is just syntactic sugar to replace for i in x(): yield i.)"

2. "There’s a second and lesser-known feature of generators that also matters. 
    You can send a value into a generator as well through its .send() method. This allows
    generators (and coroutines) to call (await) each other without blocking. 
    I won’t get any further into the nuts and bolts of this feature, because it
    matters mainly for the implementation of coroutines behind the scenes, but you shouldn’t ever really
    need to use it directly yourself."

3. In other words, asynchronous iterators and asynchronous generators are not
designed to concurrently map some function over a sequence or iterator.
They’re merely designed to let the enclosing coroutine allow other tasks to take their
turn. The async for and async with statements are only needed to the extent that using plain 
for or with would “break” the nature of await in the coroutine. This distinction between asynchronicity and concurrency 
is a key one to grasp.

4. Admittedly, the second portion of parse() is blocking, but it consists of a
quick regex match and ensuring that the links discovered are made into absolute paths.

*In this specific case, this synchronous code should be quick and inconspicuous. 
But just remember that any line within a given coroutine will block other coroutines unless 
that line uses yield, await, or return.
If the parsing was a more intensive process, 
you might want to consider running this portion in its own process with loop.run_in_executor().
