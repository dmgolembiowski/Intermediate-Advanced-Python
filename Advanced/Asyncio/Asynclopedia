1. "Technically, await is more closely analogous to yield from than it is to yield. 
    (But remember that yield from x() is just syntactic sugar to replace for i in x(): yield i.)"

2. "There’s a second and lesser-known feature of generators that also matters. 
    You can send a value into a generator as well through its .send() method. This allows
    generators (and coroutines) to call (await) each other without blocking. 
    I won’t get any further into the nuts and bolts of this feature, because it
    matters mainly for the implementation of coroutines behind the scenes, but you shouldn’t ever really
    need to use it directly yourself."
